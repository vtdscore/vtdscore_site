This organziation is dedicated to fostering an effective and supportive data science learning community at the University of Vermont.

We are a student led group dedicated to learning about and sharing tools for data science and visualization. We meet weekly to have structured lessons on different techniques, share resources, and do creative problem-solving using real data. These sessions begin with a short tutorial and finish with real-time coding of freely available datasets. Topics of interest for these tutorials include coding basics, bioinformatics, image processing, statistics, and other data analysis as the groupsâ€™ needs evolve.

In addition to the weekly seminars, we also have a dedicated Slack group where members can post questions they have about how to analyze their data, address errors they might run into, and share successes they have with the group. In addition to this instructional website, the Slack group also has a dedicated channel for learning resources which will contain an ever-growing list of tutorials, instructional videos, and educational books on data-science to enable users that wish to learn on their own outside of our instructional sessions. Although we are a student-run group, anyone who is seeking to become a more informed data scientist or start their data science education is welcome.
