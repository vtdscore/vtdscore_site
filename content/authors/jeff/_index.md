Jeff Brabec is a third year graduate student at the University of Vermont in the Neuroscience Graduate Program. He works with Matt Mahoney in the Epilepsy Cognition and Development group studying network based functional prediction (NBFP) of genes in complex diseases. He's currenlty working on a project developing NBFP for the prediction of candidate genes in Alzheimer's Disease.

Since the start of COVID-19 Jeff and his fellow NGPer and lab member Montana, started this Data Science Core to promote learning of data science skills and bionformatic techniques at UVM.
