Montana is a third year graduate student at the University of Vermont in the Neuroscience Graduate Program. She works with Matt Mahoney in the Epilepsy Cognition and Development group studying the intersection of epilepsy and genetics. Current projects focus on Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, epilepsy genetics, and network-based functional prediction for gene prioritization.  She likes bikes.

Since the start of COVID-19 Monana and her fellow NGPer and lab member Jeff, started this Data Science Core to promote learning of data science skills and bionformatic techniques at UVM.
