This R Markdown was created for the UVM Student Data Science Core group for an informational session on data visualization. The code reflects real time explanations and questions, and therefore is not cleaned up. 

Week 2: Data wrangling

```{r Install packages and data}
#read in office data from IBDM
IMDB.data <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-17/office_ratings.csv')

#read in office data from schrute package
schrute.data <- schrute::theoffice

#three different ways to visualize the tables
str(IMDB.data)
str(schrute.data)

head(IMDB.data)
head(schrute.data)

glimpse(IMDB.data)
glimpse(schrute.data)
```


```{r Data wrangling}


#who are all the writers
distinct(schrute.data, writer)
select(schrute.data, writer)
filter(schrute.data, episode == 1)


#pipe operations %>% 

#see how many episodes each writer wrote
writer.info <- 
  schrute.data %>% 
  group_by(season, episode) %>% #collapse season first, and then episode, but this will leave us with many duplicates
  distinct(writer, .keep_all = TRUE) #distinct is going to get rid of those duplicates, but also of all the other columns
#use .keep_all to keep other columns, BUT R does not distinguish between the duplicates based on previous code and just picks first row in that set of duplicates that are specified

```


Week 3:data visualization

```{r ggplot2 intro}
#ggplot: 
  # 1. provide the DATA
  # 2. map variables to AESTHETICS
  # 3. add LAYERS to render the data and aesthetics to the figure

#QUESTION: how many episodes did each writer write?
#bar chart of writer information
ggplot(schrute.data, aes(x = writer)) +
  geom_bar()

#problems?

#bar chart of writer information after creating new table
ggplot(writer.info, aes(x = writer)) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
